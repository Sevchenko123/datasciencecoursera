### Application Detail

This application generates a simple linear regression model between mpg, the dependent variable and any other variable which the user can choose as an independent variable. 

The application can be viewed at :-

* Rstudio's Shiny Server : [Simple Linear Regression App] (https://samiryelne.shinyapps.io/Shiny_Project/)

---

### Dataset Information

The **mtcars** dataset comprises of fuel consumption and other ten aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles, 1973â€“74 models. 

The names of the columns in the dataset are :-

```
##  [1] "mpg"  "cyl"  "disp" "hp"   "drat" "wt"   "qsec" "vs"   "am"   "gear"
## [11] "carb"
```

---

### How to use the app

* The user is required to choose the independent variable. The dependent variable is always mpg.
* As soon as the user selects the independent variable, a linear regression model plot is shown.
* The user could change the independent variable, in such case the plot will be updated.
* The application also shows the summary statistics of the selected variable.
